# WebTouchBar

Basic idea is using my phone to extend my laptop.

Mobile phone or pad is really good for extend keyboard,
it's a responsible touch screen. I wanna to use the power
of phone, and power of python and html5, make it cross platform.
(for me, i have windows, *nix, osx computer, and android phone
and pad, ios phone and pad)

Make my phone working like magic trackpad :-) got seamless experience 
cross platform, and easy carry. (phone and laptop should be enough)
